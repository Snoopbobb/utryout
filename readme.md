## Utryout.com built using the Laravel PHP Framework

A live web application built using Laravel, MySQL, Bootstrap, jQuery, JavaScript, Google Maps api, Stripe api, for users to post and search for youth sports tryouts in their area.

The app allows coaches and organizations to post their tryout information. Parents can then search through the tryouts to find a tryout by sport, by age, and/or by location. 

The app uses Google Maps api to map the tryouts and also uses a radius search for users to search within a selected radius for tryout listings near them.

The app also implements the Stripe api in order to charge users to use the site.

The app also alerts coaches and organizations by email if anyone plans on attending their tryout.
